# Smart_Elevator_Control
A two-elevator single call button control system implemented using Verilog and CPLD.

üìú Project Overview
The Smart Elevator Control System is designed to manage two elevators efficiently using a single call button. The system determines which elevator should respond to a call based on real-time factors such as:
‚Ä¢	The current position of the elevators.
‚Ä¢	The proximity of the call floor to each elevator.
‚Ä¢	Movement direction (up or down).
The project optimizes response times, reduces energy consumption, and provides real-time feedback through 7-segment displays and LED indicators. This makes the system efficient, user-friendly, and ideal for small to medium-scale applications like residential buildings, hospitals, and offices.

üöÄ Key Features
1.	Two-Elevator Control: Handles two elevators with a single call button.
2.	Proximity-Based Decision: The system selects the closest elevator to the call floor.
3.	Direction Feedback: Visual indication of elevator movement (UP/DOWN) via LEDs.
4.	7-Segment Display: Displays the elevator responding to the call.
5.	Real-Time Operation: Implemented on a CPLD 2900 board for fast and accurate response.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
1. Hardware Description Language: Verilog
2. Simulation Tools: Quartus II 8.1 Web Edition for code synthesis and implementation.
3. Hardware: CPLD 2900 Board
